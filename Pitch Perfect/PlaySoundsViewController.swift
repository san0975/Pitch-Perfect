    PlaySoundsViewController class allows the user to play the recorded sound back with effect.

    The play sounds view has four buttons to play the recorded
    sound file and a button to stop the playback.

    The buttons for playing the recorded sounds will have images corresponding to their sound effect:

    Chipmunk image → High­pitched sound
    Darth Vader image → Low­pitched sound
    Snail image → Slow sound
    Rabbit image → Fast sound
